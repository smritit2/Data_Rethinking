The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is key to addressing climate change 
and reducing fossil fuel reliance. This dataset from the Washington State 
Department of Licensing highlights registration trends for battery electric 
(BEVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). It aids in understanding adoption
patterns, infrastructure needs, and clean energy effectiveness, policymakers,
businesses, and consumers toward sustainable mobility.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
file_path <- "data/Cleaned_Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv"
ev_data <- read_csv(file_path)
```

```         
The dataset contains over 200,000 records of electric vehicle registrations 
in Washington State.
```

```{r}
head(ev_data)
```

```{r}
summary(ev_data)
```

```{r}
ev_type_distribution <- ev_data %>%
  group_by(Electric_Vehicle_Type) %>%
  summarize(Count = n())

ggplot(ev_type_distribution, aes(x = reorder(Electric_Vehicle_Type, -Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Electric Vehicle Types",
       x = "Vehicle Type", y = "Count")
```

```         
The majority of registrations are for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), 
indicating a strong preference for fully electric solutions over hybrids.
```

```{r}
if ("Year" %in% colnames(ev_data)) {
  ev_trends <- ev_data %>%
    group_by(Year) %>%
    summarize(Count = n())

  ggplot(ev_trends, aes(x = Year, y = Count)) +
    geom_line(color = "darkgreen") +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Trends in Electric Vehicle Registrations",
         x = "Year", y = "Count")
}
```

```         
A steady increase in EV registrations is observed, particularly post-2020, 
coinciding with growing environmental awareness and advancements in EV 
technology.
```
```{r}
ev_model_analysis <- ev_data %>%
  group_by(Make) %>%
  summarize(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>%
  head(10)
ggplot(ev_model_analysis, aes(x = Make, y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Electric Vehicle Models",
       x = "Make", y = "Count")
```
Tesla dominates the market. Other vehicles come from Nissan (Leaf) and Chevrolet 
(Bolt).


```{r}
ev_model_analysis <- ev_data %>%
  group_by(Model) %>%
  summarize(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>%
  head(10)
ggplot(ev_model_analysis, aes(x = reorder(Model, -Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Electric Vehicle Models",
       x = "Model", y = "Count")
```

```         
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y lead registrations.
```

```         
The visualizations confirm the dominance of BEVs in Washington State's electric 
vehicle population. The bar chart showcasing the distribution of EV types 
highlights the public's  clear inclination towards BEVs. This preference is 
driven by their lower emissions and decreasing costs. Temporal analysis 
demonstrates exponential growth in EV registrations.  This growth is especially noticeable in recent years. It suggests the presence of effective policy 
incentives and increased consumer confidence. The analysis of the top 10 EV 
models underscores the strong influence of Tesla on the market. This influence 
reflects Tesla's brand strength and innovation.
